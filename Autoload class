Lets start!

Most of the developers who are working with OOP(Object Oriented Programming) tends to save each class definition in a separate file. In this case, developers face a big problem. They have to include lots of files at the beginning of the document like following.

include('dog.php');
include('cat.php');
include('cow.php');
include('goat.php');
include('fox.php');
The concept “Autoloading” comes to solve this problem.

Autoloading Classes
Mainly there are two ways to define a autoload function.

spl_autoload_register function (Highly recommended)
__autoload function
Following code will register autoload function and will try to load class files.

<?php

spl_autoload_register(function($className) {
	include_once $className . '.php';
});

$dog = new dog();
$cat = new cat();

// static_methods below
echo cow::getToken();
echo fox::$name;
